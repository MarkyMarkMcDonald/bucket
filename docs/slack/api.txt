# Outgoing API

We'll show you how to handle the outgoing data, and optionally post a response
back to Slack.

## Outgoing Data
 
When a matching chat message is received, a POST will be sent to the URL(s)
specified below. The data is defined as follows:

```
token=NG4vPmqFSrNq29ZZig1SrR41
team_id=T0001
channel_id=C2147483705
channel_name=test
timestamp=1355517523.000005
user_id=U2147483697
user_name=Steve
text=googlebot: What is the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow?
trigger_word=googlebot:
```

## Responding

If the handler wishes to post a response back into the Slack channel, the
following JSON should be returned as the body of the response:

```
{
  "text": "African or European?"
}
```

Empty bodies or bodies with an empty text property will simply be ignored.
Non-200 responses will be retried a reasonable number of times. A response
will be posted using the bot name and icon specified in the Integration
Settings section below. If you would like to change the name on a per-response
basis, simply include a username property in your response.
